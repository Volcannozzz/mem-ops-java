# Mem Ops for Java
Mem Ops for Java is a Java memory manager / allocator for use in systems requiring steady state memory consumption
(as little garbage collection as possible).

The main use case is high performance, high reliability, low latency distributed systems, but Mem Ops can be used for
any use case that requires stable memory consumption.
